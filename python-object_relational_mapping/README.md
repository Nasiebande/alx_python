Python - Object-relational mapping

What is Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)?

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique used to bridge the gap between object-oriented programming languages like Python and relational databases like SQL databases (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite). It allows you to work with your database using Python classes and objects, making database interactions more intuitive and efficient.

Why use ORM?
ORM provides several benefits:

Abstraction: You can work with databases using Python objects, which are easier to understand and manipulate than raw SQL queries.

Code Reusability: ORM frameworks often provide reusable code for common database operations, reducing the need to write repetitive SQL statements.

Portability: You can switch between different database systems more easily because the ORM abstracts the database-specific code.

Security: ORM frameworks often help prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection.

Popular Python ORM Libraries:

SQLAlchemy: This is one of the most popular and comprehensive ORM libraries for Python. It supports a variety of database systems and offers both high-level and low-level APIs. You can define your database schema using Python classes and relationships.

Django ORM: If you're using the Django web framework, it comes with its own built-in ORM. It's easy to use and seamlessly integrates with the rest of Django's features.

Basic Concepts:

Models: In an ORM, models are Python classes that represent database tables. Each attribute of a model class corresponds to a column in the database.

Mapping: ORM frameworks map Python objects to database tables and their relationships. This mapping is usually defined in the form of model classes.

Sessions: ORM libraries use sessions to manage interactions between Python code and the database. A session acts as a container for objects that need to be saved, updated, or retrieved from the database.

Querying: Instead of writing raw SQL queries, you can use the ORM library's query API to perform database operations like selecting, filtering, and ordering records
